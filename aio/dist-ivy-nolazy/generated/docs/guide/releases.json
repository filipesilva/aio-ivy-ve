Stability ensures that reusable components and libraries, tutorials, tools, and learned practices don't become obsolete unexpectedly. Stability is essential for the ecosystem around Angular to thrive.</p>\n<p>We also share with you the desire for Angular to keep evolving. We strive to ensure that the foundation on top of which you are building is continuously improving and enabling you to stay up-to-date with the rest of the web ecosystem and your user needs.</p>\n<p>This document contains the practices that we follow to provide you with a leading-edge app development platform, balanced with stability. We strive to ensure that future changes are always introduced in a predictable way. We want everyone who depends on Angular to know when and how new features are added, and to be well-prepared when obsolete ones are removed.</p>\n<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n<p>The practices described in this document apply to Angular 2.0 and later. If you are currently using AngularJS, see <a href=\"guide/upgrade\" title=\"Upgrading from Angular JS\">Upgrading from AngularJS</a>. <em>AngularJS</em> is the name for all v1.x versions of Angular.</p>\n</div>\n<a id=\"versioning\"></a>\n<h2 id=\"angular-versioning\">Angular versioning<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/releases#angular-versioning\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h2>\n<p>Angular version numbers indicate the level of changes that are introduced by the release. This use of <a href=\"https://semver.org/\" title=\"Semantic Versioning Specification\">semantic versioning</a> helps you understand the potential impact of updating to a new version. </p>\n<p>Angular version numbers have three parts: <code>major.minor.patch</code>. For example, version 7.2.11 indicates major version 7, minor version 2, and patch level 11. </p>\n<p>The version number is incremented based on the level of change included in the release. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Major releases</strong> contain significant new features, some but minimal developer assistance is expected during the update. When updating to a new major release, you may need to run update scripts, refactor code, run additional tests, and learn new APIs. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Minor releases</strong> contain new smaller features. Minor releases are fully backward-compatible; no developer assistance is expected during update, but you can optionally modify your apps and libraries to begin using new APIs, features, and capabilities that were added in the release. We update peer dependencies in minor versions by expanding the supported versions, but we do not require projects to update these dependencies. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Patch releases</strong> are low risk, bug fix releases. No developer assistance is expected during update.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> As of Angular version 7, the major versions of Angular core and the CLI are aligned. This means that in order to use the CLI as you develop an Angular app, the version of <code>@angular/core</code> and the CLI need to be the same.</p>\n</div>\n<a id=\"updating\"></a>\n<h3 id=\"supported-update-paths\">Supported update paths<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/releases#supported-update-paths\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>In alignment with the versioning scheme described above, we commit to support the following update paths:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are updating within the <strong>same major version,</strong> then you can skip any intermediate versions and update directly to the targeted version. For example, you can update directly from 7.0.0 to 7.2.11.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are updating from <strong>one major version to another,</strong> then we recommend that you <strong>don't skip major versions.</strong> Follow the instructions to incrementally update to the next major version, testing and validating at each step. For example, if you want to update from version 6.x.x to version 8.x.x, we recommend that you update to the latest 7.x.x release first. After successfully updating to 7.x.x, you can then update to 8.x.x. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>See <a href=\"guide/updating\" title=\"Updating your projects\">Keeping Up-to-Date</a> for more information about updating your Angular projects to the most recent version. </p>\n<a id=\"previews\"></a>\n<h3 id=\"preview-releases\">Preview releases<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/releases#preview-releases\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>We let you preview what's coming by providing Beta releases and Release Candidates (<code>rc</code>) for each major and minor release: </p>\n<!-- \n* **Next:** The release that is under active development. The next release is indicated by a release tag appended with the  `next` identifier, such as  `8.1.0-next.0`.

A release candidate is indicated by a release tag appended with the <code>rc</code> identifier, such as version <code>8.1.0-rc</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The next version of the documentation is available at <a href=\"https://next.angular.io\">next.angular.io</a>.

Deprecated APIs appear in the <a href=\"api?status=deprecated\">documentation</a> with <del>strikethrough.</del> When we announce a deprecation, we also announce a recommended update path. For convenience,  <a href=\"guide/deprecations\">Deprecations</a> contains a summary of deprecated APIs and features. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deprecation period:</strong> When an API or a feature is deprecated, it will still be present in the <a href=\"guide/releases#schedule\">next two major releases</a>. After that, deprecated APIs and features will be candidates for removal. A deprecation can be announced in any release, but the removal of a deprecated API or feature will happen only in major release. Until a deprecated API or feature is removed, it will be maintained according to the LTS support policy, meaning that only critical and security issues will be fixed. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>npm dependencies:</strong> We only make npm dependency updates that require changes to your apps in a major release.\nIn minor releases, we update peer dependencies by expanding the supported versions, but we do not require projects to update these dependencies until a future major version. This means that during minor Angular releases, npm dependency updates within Angular applications and libraries are optional.</li>\n</ul>\n<a id=\"public-api\"></a>\n<h2 id=\"public-api-surface\">Public API surface<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/releases#public-api-surface\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h2>\n<p>Angular is a collection of many packages, sub-projects, and tools. To prevent accidental use of private APIs—and so that you can clearly understand what is covered by the practices described here—we document what is and is not considered our public API surface. For details, see <a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/docs/PUBLIC_API.md\" title=\"Supported Public API Surface of Angular\">Supported Public API Surface of Angular</a>.</p>\n<p>Any changes to the public API surface will be done using the versioning, support, and depreciation policies describe above.</p>\n<a id=\"labs\"></a>\n<h2 id=\"angular-labs\">Angular Labs<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/releases#angular-labs\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h2>\n<p>Angular Labs is an initiative to cultivate new features and iterate on them quickly. Angular Labs provides a safe place for exploration and experimentation by the Angular team.</p>\n<p>Angular Labs projects are not ready for production use, and no commitment is made to bring them to production. The policies and practices that are described in this document do not apply to Angular Labs projects.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<!-- links to this doc:\n - guide/deprecations\n - guide/updating\n-->\n<!-- links from this doc:\n - api?status=deprecated\n - guide/deprecations\n - guide/releases#angular-labs\n - guide/releases#angular-versioning\n - guide/releases#angular-versioning-and-releases\n - guide/releases#deprecation-practices\n - guide/releases#preview-releases\n - guide/releases#public-api-surface\n - guide/releases#release-frequency\n - guide/releases#release-schedule\n - guide/releases#schedule\n - guide/releases#support-policy-and-schedule\n - guide/releases#supported-update-paths\n - guide/updating\n - guide/upgrade\n - https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n - https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/docs/PUBLIC_API.md\n - https://github.com/angular/angular/edit/master/aio/content/guide/releases.md?message=docs%3A%20describe%20your%20change...\n - https://next.angular.io\n - https://semver.org/\n-->"
